->define ideas in one class and implemented by sub-class as per requirements
-> abstraction is implemented by abstract classes and interfaces.
-> interfaces giv 100% abstraction.
->canâ€™t create objects to abstract classes. But can create objects to sub classes of abstract class.
->Any class extending an abstract class must implement all abstract methods. If it does not implement, it must be declared as abstract.
->Constructors and fields can not be declared as abstract.
->Abstract methods can not be static.

Interface:
->any data members declared in interface are static final. We cannot change them in class that implements interface(compile time error)
-> static or instance blocks are not allowed
