->To uniquely identify each thread a id will be generated by jvm.
-> thread id can be used before thread itself is used,cuz once a thread is generated a id will be generated in the same moment.

->You can change the name of a thread at any state of the thread.like after you say thread.start() or thread.sleep(2000).
->default name of thread will be Thread-0.
->setName() and getName() can be used.

->bad practice to call sleep() method with an instance of Thread class. If you want a particular thread to sleep for a while, then call sleep() method inside the run() method of that thread.
-> In sleep method,if miilis value is negative or nanos value is not in the range 0 â€“ 999999 method may also throws IllegalArgumentException
